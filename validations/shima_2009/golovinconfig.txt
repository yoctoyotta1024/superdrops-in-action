##### CONFIG FILE #####
# Author: Clara Bayley
# File: golovinconfig.txt
# File containing configuration 
# for running CLEO in 0D setup with 
# golovin collision-coalescence kernel

#  Note: inital superdroplets data (eps, r0 and m_sol) read from 
#  file "initSDs_filename" is made with PYSD module using python
#  script "create_initsuperdropsbinary_script". Likewise data to make 
#  gridboxmap from gridbox boundaries is read from file "grid_filename"
#  created using python "create_gbxboundariesbinary_script" script.

### Initialisation Files parameters ###
initSDs_filename = ./bin/golovin_dimlessSDsinit.dat           # binary filename for initialisation of superdrops
grid_filename = ./bin/golovin_dimlessGBxboundaries.dat        # binary filename for gridbox boundaries

### Output Data parameters ###
setuptxt = ./bin/golovinsetup.txt              # name of .txt output file to copy setup to
zarrbasedir = ./bin/golovinsol.zarr            # zarr store base directory
maxchunk = 1250000                             # maximum no. of elements in chunks of zarr store array

### SDM parameters ###

# SDs parameters #
