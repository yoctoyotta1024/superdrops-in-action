##### CONFIG FILE #####
# Author: Clara Bayley
# File: config.txt
# File containing configuration of CLEO
# SDM = SuperDroplet Model
# SD(s) = SuperDroplet(s)
# GBx(s) = GridBox(es)

#  Note: inital superdroplets data (eps, r0 and m_sol (and optionally coord3))
#  read from file "initSDs_filename" is made with PYSD module using python
#  script "create_initsuperdropsbinary_script". Likewise data to make 
#  gridboxmap from gridbox boundaries is read from file "grid_filename"
#  created using python "create_gbxboundariesbinary_script" script.
